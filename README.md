# Pico Tracking System

Micropython and Flask code to run your tracking system with a Raspberry Pi Pico and a webserver.

This project was developed by Elsa Tcheuyap, Guilherme Pita, Junyu Guo, Rusan Sharma, Shahriyar Habib and Yining Wang for the ESC204 Class at the University of Toronto in 2021. Feel free to use the asstes here, but follow the [license](LICENSE) and cite the source.

## Microcontroller

### Micropython

To use the [Micropython files](pico-code), you must first flash Micropython to your Raspberry Pi Pico; instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/articles/programming-raspberry-pi-pico-with-python-and-micropython).

Then, use [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) to connect your flashed Pico to your computer and transfer all the files on [pico-code](pico-code) to the root directory to it.

### Hardware

Follow the code above to connect the correct wires to the modules and the correct GPIO pins. If you want to post the detailed instructions to those connections, please create a pull request.
